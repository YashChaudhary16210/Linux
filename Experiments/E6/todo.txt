Experiment 6: Shell Programming
Theory: Shell Loops, Loop control, IO Redirections, Shell Function, Regular Expressions,
Script Debugging and Troubleshooting
Lab:
i.
Write a script that checks whether a given number is a palindrome or not. A palindrome
number reads the same backward as forward.
ii.
Write a script that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common
multiple (LCM) of two given numbers.
iii.
Create a script that takes multiple numbers as input and sorts them in ascending or
descending order.
